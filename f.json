  "Art Style": "Modern Japanese anime/manga, specifically 'school life' or 'slice of life' genre. It's a 2D digital art style characterized by clean lines and cel-shaded rendering with subtle soft gradients for depth on characters, contrasted with more simplified and illustrative backgrounds. The overall aesthetic is bright and polished, often seen in visual novels or contemporary animation.",
  "Line Style": "Lines are consistently thin, crisp, and smooth, with no visible sketchiness or rough textures. Character outlines are predominantly black, but internal lines or details within colored areas (like hair strands) often use a slightly darker shade of the fill color. Background elements sometimes feature thinner or less defined outlines, or are entirely lineless, allowing them to recede and emphasize the characters.",
  "Color Palette": "The color palette is vibrant and bright, yet harmoniously balanced, avoiding harsh or overly saturated tones. It predominantly features warm skin tones, lively blues for skies, various greens for foliage, and soft browns/greys for architectural elements. Character colors are more saturated and diverse, making them stand out. Shading primarily uses cel-shading with soft, airbrushed-like gradients for gentle transitions, particularly noticeable in hair, skin, and fabric folds. Eyes feature intricate multi-layered gradients and prominent specular highlights. Background colors are often slightly desaturated compared to foreground elements to enhance depth.",
  "Vibe of the art style": "The art style evokes a lighthearted, serene, and youthful vibe. It's characterized by a sense of gentle optimism, innocence, and everyday charm, often conveying feelings of peace, nostalgia, and pleasant school life. The overall mood is uplifting and inviting, typical of comforting slice-of-life narratives.",
  "Character proportions": "Characters adhere to standard anime proportions, typically around 1:6 to 1:7 head-to-body ratio, emphasizing a slender and graceful build common for young female characters. Facial features include large, expressive eyes with detailed irises and multiple highlights, a small and delicate nose, and a soft, slightly pointed jawline. Limbs are long and slender. Hands are depicted with fine, delicate fingers, while feet are proportionally rendered, often covered by school shoes.",
  "Background colors": "Background colors are generally softer, brighter, and slightly desaturated compared to the foreground characters, effectively creating depth and focusing attention on the subjects. Dominant colors include light sky blues, various shades of green for natural elements, and muted browns, greys, and whites for architectural structures. There's often a touch of soft pink, indicative of cherry blossoms, contributing to a cheerful atmosphere.",
  "Background styles": "Backgrounds are stylized and simplified, rendered with clear perspective but reduced textural detail compared to characters. Architectural elements like school buildings are depicted cleanly with flat colors and minimal shading. Natural elements such as trees and grass are more illustrative, utilizing blocks of color and soft, airbrushed or watercolor-like textures rather than intricate individual details. Depth is achieved through atmospheric perspective, where distant elements are lighter and less saturated. The backgrounds consistently depict typical Japanese school environments (classrooms, school buildings, outdoor courtyards, cherry blossom trees), reinforcing the art's thematic context.",
  "Art theme": "The overarching art theme is 'Japanese school life' or 'slice of life,' centered around the daily experiences and youthful innocence of students. Common motifs include iconic Japanese school uniforms (sailor fuku or blazer styles), traditional school architecture, cherry blossom trees, and everyday school items like bento boxes, strongly anchoring the art within a specific cultural and narrative setting.",
  "Time Background": "The implied time background is contemporary Japan, or a slightly idealized version thereof, not set in a specific historical period. The lighting consistently suggests a bright, clear daytime environment, often sunny, with even illumination in indoor scenes. This contributes to the overall lighthearted and pleasant mood of the art style.",
  "Story background": "The art style is deeply influenced by and rooted in modern Japanese culture, specifically the 'school life' genre prevalent in anime, manga, and visual novels. The consistent depiction of Japanese school uniforms, architecture, and cultural symbols like cherry blossoms points to narratives typically centered on themes of friendship, youth, everyday adventures, and personal growth within a high school setting in Japan.",
  "Poses of subject": "Subject poses are a mix of natural and casual, ranging from relaxed standing and walking to subtle movements like running or reaching. Poses are generally moderately expressive, conveying emotion through body language and subtle gestures rather than exaggerated drama. Characters are typically depicted individually, often facing towards the viewer or engaged in simple, everyday interactions with props (e.g., holding a bento box). Camera angles are predominantly eye-level or slightly high-angle, providing a clear and engaging view of the characters and their immediate environment."
